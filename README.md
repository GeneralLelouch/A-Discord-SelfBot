# Before Setup

## Disclaimer (July 29)
Discord has been sending warning emails to people using selfbots and it seems like they may have even banned some for using them. Having said this, at this moment there is no confirmation on whether selfbots will be able to be used if they follow the rules bellow, but for now I would advice to keep an eye on your email just in case discord does send something to you. *I am not responsible for anything you decide to do with your selfbot*

Install Guide + List Of Commands

Just Fork my code and change the userid and you are good to go

Note that I have made this for my personal use and I'm hosting it on Heroku(www.dashboard.heroku.com), If you are hosting this on any other VPN, then change the "process.env.TOKEN" in "client.login" to Your TOKEN

Also I own no responsibility if your account get's banned as it's not accepted by Discord Staff  

## Rules

Please remember that selfbots arent fully suported by Discord and that it should only be used to make YOUR life easier and not others. Also keep in mind that discord has a set of semi-offical rules regarding selfbots:

+ A selfbot must not, under any circumstance, respond to other user's messages. This means it should not respond to commands, should not autoreply to certain keywords, etc. You must be the only one that can control it.
+ A selfbot must not, under any circumstance, do "invite scraping". This is the action of detecting server invites in chat, and automatically joining a server using that invite.
+ As selfbots run under your account they are subject to the same Terms of Service. Meaning they should not spam, insult or demean others, post NSFW material, spread viruses or illegal material, etc. They have to follow the same rules that you follow.

IF, and only if you accept the above rules of selfbots, then you may proceed.
